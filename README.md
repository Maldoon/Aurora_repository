# Aurora_repository
A place where I put D&amp;D ports of Homebrew content that is either requested for me to do / want to add. 

If there's any bugs, tell me. 

To use any of the Homebrew content here, go to Start > Additional Content > Index files and past the following:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Maldoon/My_Aurora_repository/main/Maldoon_Port.index

Hit the download button. Once the download is complete, restart the application by clicking the "Restart application" to apply the new content



If you are here for the fixes, then you must download the files and place them in: the user folder in your custom settings.
