            <p><em>he trackers followed their guide long and deepinto the woods. Foolishly, they ignored the archformed of willow branches. Foolishly, they paidno heed to the ring of mushrooms through which they strode. It was only when the woman stood before them atop the skinned bodies of her beloved kin, a multitude of amber-furred tails alight in witch-flame, that the hunters realized their mistake, their crime, and their sentence.</em><br></br>-Ren Kurama, Nine Tales of the Wuxian East<br></br>Trickster spirits and self-proclaimed guardians of nature, the Kitsune have beguiled and befuddled superstitious mortals since the invention of superstition itself. Kitsune famously share a mutual rivalry with Elves, both believing themselves to be the "true" wardens of the world's forested places. Elves look down on the Kitsune's oblique methods and apparent cruelty. Kitsune see Elves as a young upstart race -- which galls the eldest among them to no end.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>TRICKSTER SPIRITS</h4>
            <p>Kitsune shift regularly between the humanoid form of their adulthood and the animalistic form of their youth, treating neither as superior or more fitting than the other. Most commonly when dealing with other races, they maintain a "True Form" that balances aspects between them. Duplicitous or vengeful Kitsune tend to remain in one form or another to lure prey into a trap, not revealing their true power until it is too late to escape.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>GUARDIANS OF SECRET PLACES</h4>
            <p>Kitsune have holy sites dotted all over the world, saturated in the power of the wild pantheon most Kitsune revere. Intruders into these places are typically allowed to pass unmolested if they are ignorant of the wild gods or non malevolent toward nature. However, known despoilers of nature, such as hunters and loggers, tend to attract unwanted attention if they stumble upon a Kitsune shrine.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>Kitsune Names</h4>
            <p>Kitsune take their names from the tradition of eastern Wuxian territories, where the race was first birthed. Kitsune names are typically two syllables at least (though they can certainly grow longer) and end in a single vowel.</p>
